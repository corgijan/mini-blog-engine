# Bäckerone
<a href="https://rezepte.corgijan.dev/">[open]</a>
Bäckerone was created while cycling with my friends with the idea to take the concept of hackerone (responsible disclosure) and use it for recipes.

> Honestly, I just wanted to publish my recipes in the easiest possible way and I like the 90s style of blogging. 

> This Project aims to have as little LOC as possible and to be in the style of a 90s blogs.
